# Programming3
Repository for weekly assignments of Programming 3 for Data Science for Life Sciences 2021-2022
- Studies: Data Science for Life Sciences
- Institute: Hanzehogeschool
- Teacher: Martijn Herber

## Project Description
This course introduces students first and foremost to distributed programming (parallel programming). It introduces a number of libraries and frameworks to do so, and the underlying theory to understand them. The focus is on applying these frameworks to (big) data rather than creating new frameworks.

## Contents
Some of the tools covered are (not necessarily in this order);

- The Python Multiprocessing library
- The Dask library for parallelizing numpy/pandas/scikit-learn calculations.
- The MapReduce paradigm and the implementation of it in Apache Spark.
- Distributed data storage; Spark Dataframes and Apache Cassandra.
- The GNU Parallel library
- The SLURM workload manager

In addition to these parallel computing topics the focus in the course will also shift from writing jupyter notebook based python scripts to writing "proper" python programs with all the software engineering details. I.e. we will focus on object-oriented design, documentation, testing, debugging. It's time to write proper programs!

These folders contain README further explaining the files in this respective folder.
